In this context, it suggests that the government is providing financial support to the public without expecting anything in return, much like gravy being served as an extra on a plate. The 'gravy train' idiom carries a connotation that this free support is excessive or unsustainable. Hence, I replaced it with 'free public assistance' to convey the literal meaning of the idiom in a non-figurative way.  I also replaced 'subsidizing' with 'providing financial support' to maintain the same level of formality and precision. Please note, 'subsidize' can sometimes have a negative connotation but 'provide financial support' is a more neutral term that sounds more precise and idiomatic.
